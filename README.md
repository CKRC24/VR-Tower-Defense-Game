# VR-Tower-Defense-Game
This project is a First personal VR tower defense game developed in Unity. Different from most of the tower defense games, in order to 
provide a full immersive gaming environment, we designed the game in a First personal VR perspective. We attended a campus wide Game development contest 
and awarded **Excellent Work** for this project.

### Prerequisite & Toolkits

The following are some toolkits and their version I used when developing this project

* [Unity](https://unity3d.com/)
* [Oculus VR](https://www.oculus.com/)
* [Xbox one controller]

## Gameworld Description & Players Ability

The design of the game world is in low-poly style, that is because we didn't have GPU during development, so in order to stablize the 
frame rate, we choose a less sophisticated texture for 3D models. Players have to go through 3 levels, defend their tower from the invading minions
and beat the final boss to win this game. We designed the navigation map for the AI minions and all animations involved in the game. The following 
are some players abilities:

* [Move & Jump]: Player is allowed to move around in the game world with the Xbox one controller, and they can adjust there vision using the 
Oculus VR headset.
* [Fire & Create Obstacles]: Player could fire fireballs at minions and also create obstacles to block invading minion waves.
* [Switch Tower]: There are more than one tower in the game, so player can switch between towers and think of more complicated strategies to win the game.
